An Outlook add-in that shows **Swiss public transport connections** for the current appointment.  
It uses the [search.ch timetable API](https://search.ch/fahrplan/api) to query real-time and timetable data and displays convenient outbound/return journeys directly in the Outlook task pane.

> **Note:** This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected to SBB, search.ch, Microsoft, or any Swiss transport operator.

## Legacy Version

Looking for the classic **Windows-only VSTO add-in**? It's still available at:
- **Repository**: https://github.com/mbeer/OutlookSwissPTTimetable
- **Download**: https://timetable.mbeer.ch/setup.exe

⚠️ **Note**: The legacy VSTO version is no longer actively maintained. Critical security fixes may still be applied, but new features will only be added to the Office.js version.

**Why upgrade to Office.js?** The Office.js version offers cross-platform support (Windows, Mac, Web), no installation required, and modern development practices. Simply sideload the manifest file to get started.

---

## Features

- Display **outbound** and **return** connections for the current Outlook appointment.
- Support for multiple Swiss languages (de-CH, fr-CH, it-CH, rm-CH) and en-GB.
- User-defined **favourite stops** with walking times.
- Autocompletion for stops using the search.ch completion API.
- Compact connection tables with duration, route chain and easy selection of the desired connection.
- Works in Outlook for Windows (and, where supported, in the new Outlook / Outlook on the web).

## Tech Stack

- Outlook Add-in (Office.js)
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript (no framework)
- [search.ch timetable API](https://search.ch/fahrplan/api)
- Icons based on [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) (see below for licensing)

---

## Getting Started (Development)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Outlook desktop (Microsoft 365) and/or Outlook on the web with sideloading enabled

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Run the dev server

```bash
npm start
```

This will:

- start the local web server (typically on `https://localhost:3000/`)
- build and serve the task pane (`taskpane.html`, `taskpane.js`, assets, …)

### Sideload into Outlook

1. Ensure `manifest.xml` points to your local dev URLs (e.g. `https://localhost:3000/...`).
2. In Outlook, sideload the add-in by adding `manifest.xml` via  
   **File → Manage Add-ins** (or **Get Add-ins → My add-ins → Add from file**, depending on Outlook version).
3. Open a calendar appointment and start the add-in from the ribbon.

Alternatively, follow Microsoft’s official sideload guide: https://aka.ms/olksideload
Trust the development certificate via `npx office-addin-dev-certs install`.

### Troubleshooting (Dev Server / OWA)

- 403 Forbidden on `https://localhost:3000/assets/...` in Outlook/OWA:
   - Ensure webpack dev server allows cross-origin requests:
      - `allowedHosts: "all"`, and CORS headers in `devServer.headers`
   - Restart dev server: `npm run dev-server`
   - Restart Outlook: `npm stop` then `npm start -- desktop --app outlook`
- Icons missing in ribbon/taskpane:
   - Verify asset URLs resolve in browser (`https://localhost:3000/assets/icon-32.png` etc.)
   - Trust dev cert (`npx office-addin-dev-certs install`)
- OWA caching:
   - Remove and re-add the add-in, then hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

---

## Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This should create an optimised production build (depending on your build setup).  
Update the URLs in `manifest.xml` to point to your production host, e.g.:

- `https://timetable.mbeer.ch/taskpane.html`
- `https://timetable.mbeer.ch/assets/icon-32.png`
- …

Then deploy the built files to your web server and redistribute / upload the updated `manifest.xml`.

## Configuration

### search.ch API

This add-in uses the search.ch timetable and completion APIs.  
No API key is required. Please comply with the terms and conditions of search.ch.

### Default / Favourite Stops

Users can define a list of favourite stops with walking times.  
These favourites are used as editable dropdowns in the task pane for:

- meeting location
- outbound "from"
- inbound "to"

Favourite stops are stored in browser localStorage under key `owpttFavoriteStopsV1` as a JSON array with the format:
```json
[{"name": "Stop Name", "walkMinutes": 5}]
```

### Translations

All UI texts are centralised in `owpttTranslations` (in `src/taskpane/owpttTranslations.js`).  
Currently supported:

- German (Switzerland) - de-CH
- French (Switzerland) - fr-CH
- Italian (Switzerland) - it-CH
- Romansh - rm-CH
- English (UK) - en-GB

**Adding new languages**: Copy the en-GB object from `owpttTranslations` and translate all values to the target language. Add locale override to `manifest.xml` under DisplayName and Description sections. Create installation screenshots (steps 1-3) for the new locale.
